# Porter - Convert Code from one Language to Another

Hi! This extension utilizes the Gemini API by Google to port code snippets from one language to another.
You can use it to convert a given file into some other language or even a small portion of the file to the target language.

## Usage

First of all you will require an API key for the Gemini Pro Model. You can easily get one from [MakerSuite](https://makersuite.google.com).

1. Select the code that you want to convert and press Ctrl + Shift + P to open the command pallete and search for 'Convert Code'.

2. If you are using the extension for the first time you'll be prompted to add your API key.

3. Now you will be prompted to provide the target language.

And Done!
You will be able to see your code snippet in a temporary window that opens in a side panel inside your editor.
